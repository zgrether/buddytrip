-- 093 — save_game_config: block the Setup→Scoring transition for a competition-attached
-- game worth 0 points.
--
-- A game created via "Add a game" starts at 0 points; the owner/delegate sets its value
-- whenever they get to it (setup is a deliberate build-up over months, per CLAUDE.md's
-- Money/points-weighting note — nothing about that changes here). But nothing today stops
-- a 0-point game from going live: it can be played a full round, scored correctly, and
-- finalized while contributing nothing to the cup. The failure is invisible for the ENTIRE
-- time it's fixable — it only matters at finalization, which is exactly when it's too late.
--
-- A partial version of this already existed client-only, for match play alone (C3 —
-- `MatchGameView.tsx`'s `enableReady`, `pointsReady(effectiveTotal)`). This is that same
-- idea, moved server-side (the client gate was never backed here — verified: NONE of the
-- three existing go-live branches below checked points at all) and extended to all four
-- formats via the ONE shared transition point every format's Save already funnels through.
--
-- Standalone (no competition) games are UNAFFECTED — same short-circuit shape as the
-- client's `!gameCompId ||`. `competition_id` doesn't change within this call, so the value
-- already fetched into the FOR UPDATE row above is used; no second read needed for it.
--
-- Distribution VALIDITY (does a started placement split sum to the total) is untouched here
-- — #665 already enforces that at save via a zod cross-field check in the games.saveConfig
-- tRPC procedure (`superRefine` on `pointsDistribution`/`pointsTotal`), before this RPC is
-- ever called. This migration adds only the nonzero check; the distribution editor is not
-- touched.
--
-- Applies uniformly to a re-affirming save of an ALREADY-scoring game too (v_go_live is true
-- on true→true, same as the existing match/grouping checks below) — this does NOT disable an
-- already-live 0-point game (scoring_enabled is never flipped false by this branch), but a
-- future settings save on one WILL be refused until a point value is set. Confirmed via a
-- read-only prod query before writing this: 16 existing rows match (competition-attached,
-- scoring_enabled, 0/null points) — every one of them dev/test residue (trip titles like
-- "Rack Trip", "D1 Trip", "Outcome E2E Trip", "BBMI Playground") pre-dating Step 0 (#636)
-- moving CI/local dev off shared prod. The real BBMI 2026 competition's one game is still in
-- setup (scoring_enabled=false, points_total=null) — entirely unaffected either way.
--
-- 081–092 applied and immutable; this is a new migration. Everything else is 089 verbatim
-- (CREATE OR REPLACE re-emits the whole body).
