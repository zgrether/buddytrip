# BuddyTrip — Permission Model

*Authoritative reference for which roles can perform which actions.*
*Enforced via `requireTripRole()` middleware (tRPC), RLS policies
(migrations 003, 008, 009, 010), and frontend `canEdit`/`isOwner` guards.*

---

## Roles

| Role | Variable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Owner** | `viewerRole === 'owner'` | Full control. Creates the trip, manages the crew, locks decisions. |
| **Planner** | `viewerRole === 'planner'` | Planning authority. Can edit trip details, manage dates, add ideas, add crew. Cannot lock destinations or manage roles. |
| **Member** | `viewerRole === 'member'` | Participant. Can vote, comment, chat, and view everything. Cannot edit trip configuration. |

**Derived flags used in code:**
- `isOwner = viewerRole === 'owner'`
- `canEdit = viewerRole === 'owner' || viewerRole === 'planner'`

## RLS Enforcement Summary

These are implemented in production via Supabase RLS policies.

### Owner-only actions
RLS checks `trip_members.role = 'owner'` for the requesting user:

- Destination lock / unlock / override
- Idea creation and removal
- Crew role management (promote, demote, remove)
- Trip settings (series link, ownership transfer, archive, delete)
- Expense split modification

### Owner + Planner actions
RLS checks `trip_members.role IN ('owner', 'planner')`:

- Trip description edit
- Idea detail editing (description, pros/cons, golf, activities, lodging)
- Date setup, poll management, and date locking
- Quick info tile CRUD
- Competition setup (enable, disable, teams, rounds, sides)
- Crew addition and invitations
- Expense creation
- Booking creation

### All-member actions
RLS checks `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM trip_members WHERE trip_id = ? AND user_id = auth.uid())`:

- Vote on destinations and dates
- Comment on ideas
- Send chat messages (trip channel)
- Enter scores
- Change own RSVP status
- View all trip data

### Team-scoped actions
RLS checks team assignment in addition to trip membership:

- View team chat: `team_assignments.user_id = auth.uid() AND team_assignments.team_id = message.team_id`
- Send team chat: same check on INSERT

## Resolved Design Decisions

These were open questions during development. Documented here for reference.

| Question | Decision |
|----------|---------|
| Score entry gating | Any trip member can enter scores — no role restriction |
| Expense editing scope | Owner-only for split modification |
| Idea creation | Owner-only (simplifies idea-stage flow) |
| Idea removal | Owner-only |
| Self-service RSVP | Implemented — members change their own status |
| Trip creation | Any logged-in user can create |
