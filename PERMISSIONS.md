# BuddyTrip — Permission Model

*Authoritative reference for which roles can perform which actions.*
*Enforced via `requireTripRole()` / `requireTripMember` middleware (tRPC,
`src/server/middleware.ts`), Supabase RLS policies, and frontend
`canEdit`/`isOwner` guards. The tRPC gates are the source of truth — this doc
mirrors them.*

*Last reconciled against the code: 2026-06-07 (see **Audit notes** at the end
for what changed and the open questions).*

## Roles

The role lives on `trip_members.role`. The middle role's value is **`Organizer`**
in both code and DB — renamed from `Planner` in migration 029 (PR #339), across
the `TripRole` type, every `requireTripRole` gate, the CHECK constraints, and all
30 RLS policies. The trip-state word **`planning`** and the planning/organizers
chat visibility (`messages.visibility = 'planning'`) were intentionally left
unchanged — those describe a phase, not the role.

| Role | Code/DB value (`TripRole`) | Description |
|------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | `'Owner'` | Full control. Creates the trip, owns the crew roster, locks decisions, transfers/deletes the trip. |
| **Organizer** | `'Organizer'` | Planning authority. Edits trip details, dates, ideas, lodging, agenda, competition, news, tiles. Cannot manage the roster, lock the destination, transfer, or delete. |
| **Member** | `'Member'` | Participant. Views everything on the trip, votes, chats (crew), logs expenses + own travel. Cannot edit trip configuration. |

**Derived flags used in code:**
- `isOwner = viewerRole === 'Owner'`
- `canEdit = viewerRole === 'Owner' || viewerRole === 'Organizer'`

**Hierarchy & access notes:**
- `requireTripRole(min)` is **hierarchical**: Owner (3) ≥ Organizer (2) ≥ Member (1). So an Owner satisfies any Organizer-gated action; `requireTripRole("Organizer")` admits Owner **and** Organizer, not Members.
- **Non-members are fully blocked.** There is no "outsider" / guest read role — `requireTripMember` rejects anyone without a `trip_members` row (`FORBIDDEN`). Access is all-or-nothing membership.
- The **Organizers chat** is the one place "Organizer" is gated by message visibility (`visibility = 'planning'`) rather than the role check directly — same effect (Owner + Organizer only).

> **Roster-removal lock once scoring starts (team-identity).** Once a competition
> has **any entered score** (`score_entries` exists for any of its games), its team
> rosters are **locked for REMOVALS** — `teamAssignments.remove`, a *move/trade*
> (`teamAssignments.assign` to a **different** team), and `teams.delete` all throw
> (`PRECONDITION_FAILED`). **Adding** a player to a team (`assign` with no prior
> membership) stays allowed — an add can't orphan anyone in an existing match.
> Before the first score, full roster editing per the role gates above. Enforced
> server-side (`assertRosterUnlocked`); the Rosters sheet disables the removal
> controls with an explanation (the add path stays live). Leaderboard standings are
> never gated — they stay visible to all roles. Mid-competition trades are parked in
> DEFERRED (durable per-score attribution); this lock is the BBMI-safe stance.

> **Per-game organizer delegation (Slice D1 §8).** Game edit/configure/enter-results
> resolves to **`canEdit || isGameOrganizer(gameId)`** — trip Owner/Organizer, OR a
> user granted organizer of *that specific game* (`game_organizers` row). It is
> **game-isolated**: a pick'em delegate cannot touch the scramble. Enforced at BOTH
> layers — the `requireGameEdit` tRPC middleware and the `is_game_organizer(game)`
> RLS path on `games` (UPDATE) + `game_results` (migration 045). Granting is a
> trip-staff act (`requireTripRole('Organizer')`).

> **Competition RUN-actions are owner/game-delegate scoped — narrower than game
> edit (Slice D Run/Post §5).** Posting results and opening score correction
> (`games.post` / `games.openCorrection`) gate on **`isOwner || isGameOrganizer(gameId)`**
> — the trip **Owner** or *that game's* delegate. A plain **Organizer (the trip
> planner) is NOT a run-action** unless they're also the game's delegate: running
> the competition is owner/delegate-scoped, distinct from trip-planner scope.
> Enforced server-side by `requireGameRunAction`. "Post" publishes the current
> standing and is **re-runnable** (Open → Posted ⇄ Correcting) — never a permanent
> finalize. A posted game's scores are frozen (`scores.upsertEntry`/`deleteEntry`
> return FORBIDDEN) until the owner/delegate opens correction; results stay
> visible to everyone throughout.

> **Scoring is Organizer+ today** (`setPlacements`). There is no member-facing
> "enter your own score" path yet — the intent (see Resolved notes) is for any
> member to score games they're in, once the scoring engine is rebuilt.

## Audit notes (2026-06-07)

This pass reconciled the doc against the tRPC routers. Highlights:

### Nomenclature
- **Planner → Organizer** — now a *full* rename (migration 029 / PR #339): the
  `TripRole` type, every `requireTripRole` gate, the `trip_members.role` +
  `invites.role` CHECK constraints, and all 30 RLS policies store/check
  `'Organizer'`. The trip-state word **`planning`** and the organizers-chat
  visibility (`messages.visibility = 'planning'`) were deliberately kept — they
  name a phase, not the role. Role-variable casing also corrected to
  capitalized (`'Owner'`, etc.) — the old doc used lowercase (`'owner'`).

### Removed — rows deleted because the feature no longer exists
- **Link/unlink series** — the `series` table/feature was dropped (migration
  024). No router, no UI.
- **Archive trip** — no `trips.archive`. (Idea archiving exists via
  `archivedIdeas`, which is different and now documented.)
- **Comment on idea** — the `idea_comments` table + router were removed in
  pre-launch cleanup (`ideas.ts:28-29`).
- **Planning progress arc** — the stepper/arc was removed (only a stale test
  reference remains).
- **`datePoll.notifyCrewPollOpen` / `resetPoll`** — these procedure names no
  longer exist; the live equivalents are `unlock` / `returnToPoll`.
- Granular idea rows (**edit pros/cons, remove golf course, remove activity,
  reopen vote, override destination, full comparison view**) — collapsed into
  the single `ideas.update` (Organizer+) the code actually exposes. The
  multi-option side-by-side "comparison" flow described in the old doc isn't a
  set of role-gated endpoints anymore.

### Corrected — behavior the old doc had wrong
- **Add expense** — old doc said Organizer+ (`canEdit`); code allows **any
  member** (`expenses.create` is `requireTripMember`). Documented as any member.
- **Vote on behalf of member** — old doc said Organizer+; code is **Owner only**
  (`castVoteForMember`).
- **Disable/delete competition** & **delete team** — Owner only (the old doc
  lumped all competition edits under `canEdit`).
- **Organizers chat** — the old "trip chat: any member" row missed the
  crew-vs-organizers split; planning-visibility chat is Owner+Organizer only.
- **`clearChannel`** (clear a chat) — Owner only; wasn't documented.

### Added — features missing from the old doc
News/trip board, schedule/agenda (was conflated with logistics), idea-lodging
suggestions, archived ideas, team assignments, expense opt-out + remove, the
profile/account + feedback endpoints, and the full logistics CRUD (the old doc
only listed view + add).

### Resolved (product decisions, 2026-06-07)
- **RSVP — removed, confirmed.** There is no self-service RSVP and none is
  planned. `trip_members.status` stays purely as Owner-managed membership state
  (in / invited / out); the only "RSVP" left in the code is comments noting its
  removal. No action.
- **Score entry — intent: any member.** A member should be able to enter/edit
  the score of any game they're in. This is **not built yet** — there's no
  scores router; today's only scoring path is `events.setPlacements`
  (Organizer+). Captured here as the target permission for the scoring engine
  when it ships (member-scoped to games they belong to).
- **Add expense — any member.** Confirmed; matches `expenses.create`
  (`requireTripMember`).

### RLS parity audit (2026-06-07)
Compared every live write-policy (post-029) to the tRPC matrix above.

**Result:** RLS is **equal-or-looser** than the tRPC gates everywhere — never
*stricter* — so no tRPC-allowed action is blocked by RLS (no broken features),
and because **all writes go through tRPC** (correctly gated), there is no active
access hole. Most tables match exactly (member SELECT; member expense insert +
Owner split-edit; Owner idea-create / Organizer idea-edit; Organizer logistics /
schedule / news / tiles / competition; Owner competition+team delete; member
votes/reads).

Spots where RLS was *looser* than the tRPC intent — harmless today (tRPC is the
only write path) but tightened in **migration 030** so RLS is a true backstop:

| Table / cmd | Was | Now (migration 030) |
|-------------|-----|---------------------|
| `trip_members` INSERT/UPDATE | self **or** Owner+Organizer | self **or** Owner — matches Owner-only roster mgmt |
| `invites` INSERT | any trip member | Owner — matches `inviteByEmail` |
| `date_poll_votes` "_ghost" (vote for a guest) | Owner+Organizer | Owner — matches `castVoteForMember` |

**`trips` UPDATE left as Owner+Organizer (intentional).** Organizers
legitimately update most trip columns (rename, about, dates, change
destination); only `lockDestination` / `transferOwnership` are Owner-only, and
those are **column-level** distinctions row-level RLS can't express without a
trigger. tRPC enforces them — not worth a trigger for defense-in-depth here.
